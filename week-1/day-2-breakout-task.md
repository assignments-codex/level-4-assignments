#### Goal

Add a small resource and handle reads and writes.

#### Steps

1. Create a data source in your project and return a list from GET /items.
2. Accept a payload on POST /items and add it to the list. Return 201 on create.
3. Extra practice if you want
   - GET /items/:id with 404 when not found
   - a logger that prints method and path
