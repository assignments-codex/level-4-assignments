# Level-4 Capstone

Use on Friday. Each student presents as if interviewing for a developer role: show the live app, walk through code, answer questions, and complete a short **live-coding** exercise. For team projects, assess each student individually.

---

## Evaluator Flow (10–12 minutes total)

1. **Live demo** (≈2 min): show frontend -> backend -> database flow.
2. **Code walkthrough** (≈3–4 min): selected files/routes/components; explain design and data flow.
3. **Q&A on code** (≈2–3 min): evaluator selects areas; student explains to confirm understanding.
4. **Live coding** (≈3–4 min, no AI): implement a small task from the list below.

_Tips: Look for clear communication, working end-to-end flow, and deployment readiness (Netlify + Render + Supabase)._

## Scoring (100 points)

- **A. Live coding – 50 pts total** _(award 0/5/10 pts for each item)_

  - Correct, runnable solution to the prompt.
  - Input validation or safe error handling (status codes, try/catch, etc.).
  - Clear, idiomatic JS (organized logic, good naming).
  - Think-aloud reasoning while coding.
  - Quick test or self-check (curl/Postman/console) before finishing.

- **B. Explaining code – 30 pts total** _(award 0/5/10 pts for each item)_

  - Architecture intent & trade-offs (why this structure, stack, or approach).
  - Data flow & request handling (React -> Express -> Supabase).
  - Constraints & alternatives (auth, keys, performance, validation).

- **C. Presentation & professionalism – 20 pts total** _(5 pts each)_

  - Live links first; clear working demo.
  - Concise, accurate communication; technical vocabulary used correctly.
  - Organized delivery; stays within 10–12 minutes.
  - Q&A handled clearly; acknowledges unknowns and suggests next steps.

**Total:** \_\_/100

## Live-coding demonstration

Student will complete one short task, such as:

- Add or modify an **Express route** that reads/writes data in Supabase.
- Add **input validation** or error handling in an API endpoint.
- Write a **React function** that fetches data from the API and renders it.
- Show how to handle **loading or error states** in the UI.
- Add a **new field or table** in Supabase and adjust one route accordingly.

> Equivalent tasks of similar scope are acceptable. Brief verification via console or Postman is encouraged.

### Passing guidance

- Typical pass: **70+/100** with a working live-coding solution and clear explanations.
- Flag for re-review if live-coding fails **and** the student cannot explain their API or data flow.
