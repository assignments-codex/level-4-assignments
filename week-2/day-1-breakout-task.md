#### Goal

Connect to Supabase and define one table

#### Steps

1. Create a Supabase project and database.
2. In the SQL editor, create a table for your resource with an id and a couple of fields.
3. Set env vars in your server: SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (or server key on the server side only).
4. Extra practice if you want
   - insert two rows from the SQL editor
   - create a quick README section with the table name and columns
