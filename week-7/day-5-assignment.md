#### Objective

Stabilize and refine. Prepare to present.

#### Requirements

1. Smoke test from a fresh clone: install, env, start both apps. Resolve any blockers you hit.
2. Server: centralized error handler returns a consistent JSON shape { "error": "message" }.
3. Server: CORS configured for your live frontend (if deployed) and localhost.
4. Client: add input validation on the create form and show a short error message.
5. Client: add a visible loading placeholder and a clear empty state.
6. Repo hygiene: update README with install, env, start steps for both apps; include live links if deployed. Ensure .env.example files are complete.

#### Submission

Repo link(s). Live URLs if deployed.

#### Rubric (20 pts)

- Runs cleanly from README 0-5
- Consistent error model and CORS set correctly 0-5
- Validation + loading/empty states in UI 0-5
- Configuration clarity and .env.example present 0-5
