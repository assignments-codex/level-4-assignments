#### Goal

Start an Express server and return JSON from two GET routes that imitate a public API.

#### Steps

1. Stand up Express and add a root route that returns JSON.
2. Pick any public API and model two GET route responses after it.
3. Extra practice if you want
   - add one POST that returns JSON you define
   - time yourself rebuilding the server from scratch
   - try a tool that speeds your workflow (nodemon or a REST client)
