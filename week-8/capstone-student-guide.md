You’ll build a **small full-stack web app** and present it on Friday in an interview-style session. You are **not graded on theme or visuals**. Focus on **getting your stack wired up** and **showing one working user flow** from front to back.

---

## What you are building

- A **React frontend** on **Netlify**
- An **Express API** on **Render**
- A **Supabase** database with at least one table
- A short, working demo that shows how data moves from **frontend -> backend -> database**

This project is about **functionality and clarity**, not design.

---

## Minimum requirements (build checklist)

Make sure your project includes all of the following:

- **Live frontend** on Netlify and **live API** on Render.
- **Public GitHub repo** (or mono-repo with client/server folders).
- **Supabase database** with at least one working table.
- At least **two API routes** that read/write data from Supabase.
- One **React page** that fetches and displays data from your API.
- One **form or button** that creates or updates data in Supabase.
- Basic **error handling** (display a friendly message if something fails).
- **README** with setup instructions, live links, and short architecture notes.

> Optional: simple auth using Supabase or JWT. Not required to pass.

## Friday presentation (10–12 minutes total)

1. **Live demo** (≈2 min)
   Show your working flow: how data moves from UI -> API -> DB -> back.
2. **Code walkthrough** (≈3–4 min)
   Open one React file and one Express route; explain how they connect.
3. **Q&A** (≈2–3 min)
   Be ready to explain your API endpoints and data structure.
4. **Live coding** (≈3–4 min, no AI)
   A short Level-4 task chosen by your instructor.

---

## Live-coding demonstration (what to expect)

You’ll perform one small coding task related to this course, such as:

- Creating a **new API route** that returns or filters data from Supabase.
- Adding a **POST** or **PATCH** endpoint with basic validation.
- Writing a **React function** to fetch and render a list from the API.
- Showing how you handle **loading and error states**.
- Explaining a **database query** and how it connects to your endpoint.

Keep it small, clear, and testable.

---

## What to submit

- **Frontend URL (Netlify)**
- **API URL (Render)**
- **Repo URL (GitHub)**
- **README** that includes:
  - One-paragraph product description (what it does and why).
  - Quick setup instructions for both client and server.
  - Architecture overview:
    - How React calls the API
    - How the API calls Supabase
    - Table name(s) and fields
  - `.env.example` showing needed keys (no real secrets).

- Clear communication and timing (0–5)
- Organized repo and README (0–5)
- Confident handling of Q&A (0–5)

**Total:** \_\_/100

## Tips for success

- Keep it **small and stable**. One clean flow > several unfinished ones.
- **Test your deployment early** (Render and Netlify often need minor config fixes).
- Use **environment variables** for Supabase keys; don’t hardcode them.
- Make sure you can **run a full demo without editing code**.
- **Practice your demo**: show the live app, then the key files.
- Have **your .env.example** ready so the instructor can clone and test it.
