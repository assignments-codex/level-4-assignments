#### Goal

Update and delete with clear statuses

#### Steps

1. Implement PATCH or PUT /items/:id to update a row. Return 200 on success, 404 when not found.
2. Implement DELETE /items/:id. Return 204 on success, 404 when not found.
3. Extra practice if you want
   - standardize error messages across routes in a small helper
